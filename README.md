# Java_OOP
The "Java OOP" course will teach you the principles of object-oriented object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and subclasses, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. We will go into the most commonly used design patterns. I will emphasize the attention to component testing (written on unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD) used on reflection.

Additional information for tasks' code:
The classes are written in a single file because the task execution logic is for the purpose of presenting the approach and code cleanliness.
